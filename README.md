## Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- PHP - For rendering all of the pages.
- JavaScript - For adding functionality to the page
- [jQuery] - duh
- [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
- Socket.io - For realtime operations
- [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) - As the templating engine
- [phpsocket.io](https://github.com/walkor/phpsocket.io) - For using socket.io with PHP
- 
## Installation

AlphaDate requires PHP 7.0+ to run.

```sh
php composer.phar update
```

In order to run the chat Socket.io handler:
